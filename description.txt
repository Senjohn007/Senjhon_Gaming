🚀 Project Launch: Senjhon Gaming

Built a full-stack MERN mini-games platform featuring 12 browser-based games like Snake, Tic-Tac-Toe, Minesweeper, Breakout, and Flappy Bird.

Developed with React + Vite + Tailwind CSS, and powered by a Node.js, Express, MongoDB backend with JWT authentication, user profiles, and per-game leaderboards.

This project showcases my skills in SPA architecture, REST API design, state management, and database-driven applications.
